        <h1>WACTOR</h1>
        <p>production</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="history">
        <div class="background">WACTOR Production began as a VTuber unit named Mirais which was formed on March 2019, with Hizuki Miu, Irisu Mia and Otogi Lilu as its first three members. WACTOR was eventually established as company on July 2019.</div>
        <div class="A2021">Throughout January and February, WACTOR's talents began expanding towards Spanish-speaking fanbases, which caused a sudden surge in subscriber numbers. On 16 January, Miu was the first to publish a presentation video in Spanish, followed by Lia on 19 January, Hana on 24 January, and Piyoko on 10 February.<br>
            On 17 March, WACTOR's Twitter account announced auditions endorsed by bilibili for five new members (now known as second generation), from 17 March to 5 April. <br>         
            On 25 April, a public audition event featuring the 15 finalists was held on bilibili, with Komori Chiyu and Otome Oto as guest commentators.     <br>      
            Throughout May, the second generation made their debuts: Shino Laila and Hoshina Suzu on 9 May, Kurari Rose on 18 May, and Hina Misora on 25 May. <br>           
            On 16 June, WACTOR's members were re-organized into generations according to their audition and debut date. <br>           
            On 30 June, WACTOR announced auditions for a third generation and opened early registrations.</div>
        <div class="A2020">On 11 January, Irisu Mia announced her retirement via Twitter, and graduated on 29 February.<br>
            On 26 January, a large amount of data about upcoming members was deleted from the company's cloud storage. After it was found that one of the many IPs involved belonged to a former employee, on 12 March Komori Aina's and Mashiro Yuyu's contracts were cancelled, and all VTuber units were merged to form one group called "WACTOR."     <br>      
            On 28 January, WACTOR introduced Nanaha Rui, their first bilibili-exclusive VTuber (or Virtual UP).<br>            
            On 2 February, Kokoro Ichiru made his debut.     <br>       
            At some point in 2020 (presumed late December, which also coincides with the termination of Kokoro Ichiru's contract), archives on graduated Otogi Lilu's and Irisu Mia's channels were wiped, leaving their respective Twitter accounts the only official way to view their stream logs.</div>
        <div class="A2019">On 3 October, WACTOR's Twitter account announced auditions for two new members for Mirais and four new members for a sister unit. Over the following days, WACTOR introduced five of their new talents: Mihana Rio, Komori Aina, Tsukito Hana and Mashiro Yuyu, who would form the new sister unit, and Kogure Piyoko, who would join Mirais. The silhouette of another character was teased as well, and would later be revealed to be Mitsurugi Lia.<br>
            On 25 October, Otogi Lilu announced her retirement via Twitter. She graduated on 16 November.  <br>          
            On 21 November, WACTOR introduced Mitsurugi Lia, a new member for Mirais. <br>           
            On 12 December, Mihana Rio's contract was cancelled due to a serious contract breach.</div>
